# Risk, Artificial Intelligence and Discrete Geometry

![ci](https://github.com/munichpavel/risk-ai-workshop/actions/workflows/ci-cd.yml/badge.svg)

## Quick-start

* `git clone` the repository and `cd` into the root directory.
* For the exercise Jupyter notebooks
  * create a virtual environment (recommended)  e.g. with [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html), [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) or other.
  * install python dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt` in a virtual environment. Note: the [fake-data-for-learning package](https://github.com/munichpavel/fake-data-for-learning) has some non-python dependencies; see its [installation instructions](https://github.com/munichpavel/fake-data-for-learning/blob/main/README.md#installation).

## Workshop topics

Slides are built as part of the repo's [ci-cd pipeline](.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml), and be found under [releases](https://github.com/munichpavel/risk-ai-workshop/releases). See e.g. [the v2022.1.1 release](https://github.com/munichpavel/risk-ai-workshop/releases/tag/v2022.1.1).

### Artificial intelligence for risk management

[Examples and exercises](notebooks/introduction-examples-exercises.ipynb)

### Discrete geometry for risk

Examples and exercises: [graphical models](notebooks/graphical-models-exercises.ipynb), [probability polytopes](notebooks/probability-polytope-exercises.ipynb), and [simpson's paradox](notebooks/simpsons-paradox-examples-exercises.ipynb)

### Correlation and causality

[Examples and exercises](notebooks/causal-models-exercises.ipynb)

### Risk and Artificial Intelligence in practice

* [Model Selection Examples](notebooks/model-selection-examples.ipynb)
* [Risk and AI in Practice Exercises](notebooks/risk-ai-practice-exercises.ipynb)
* [Model Selection Exercises (from 2017 workshop)](notebooks/model-selection-exercises.ipynb)

## Grading scheme for University of Ljubljana Masters in Mathematical Finance

The number of points for a correct solution for each exercise brings is equal to $2^{\mathrm{number\,of\,stars}}$. For a grade of 8 you have to get at least 6 points, for grade 9 at least 7 points and for 10 at least 8 points.

You have to solve one problem from each of the four sets of problems unless you solved one of the problems with three stars.

## Relate python packages

In the exercise notebooks and `requirements.txt` you see which python packages I used in creating and solving the exercises, though this list is far from exhaustive. Below are some (additional) python packages that may be useful

## Graph visualization

* [graphviz](https://graphviz.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
* [networkx](https://networkx.github.io/), plus many graph operations

## Bayesian networks, causal inference

* [pgmpy](https://pgmpy.org/)
* [brent](https://koaning.github.io/brent/)
* [causalgraphicalmodels](https://github.com/ijmbarr/causalgraphicalmodels)
* [causality](https://github.com/akelleh/causality)
* [dowhy](https://microsoft.github.io/dowhy/)
* [pyro](https://pyro.ai/)

## Releases

### Process of creating a new workshop release

If the release is for a new workshop year, then first manually change the version in the code-base to `<new-year>.0.0`. This release need not be a tagged release, as it is the same as the final release of the previous workshop in an earlier year.

Once an initial release has been created for a new workshop, create subsequent tagged releases by using [bump2version](https://pypi.org/project/bump2version/).

## Release history

Note: I do not follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) for this project. For the first digit (in semver, `major`), I use the year of the target workshop, and for the last (in semver `patch`), I increment when a chunk of work is done towards giving the workshop. The middle digit (in semver, `minor`) stays on 0 until I give the workshop, when it bumps to 1. Fixes to the given workshop get reflected in the patch versions `yyyy.1.<patch-version>`.

### Latest

### v2022.1.1

* Fix typos in discrete geometry slides, including definition of d-separation
* Fix hit-rate average treatment effect results in slides
* Add ci / cd release step to make ci / cd slide artifacts publicly available

### v2022.1.0

Refactor introduction and concluding lectures, as well as their exercises
